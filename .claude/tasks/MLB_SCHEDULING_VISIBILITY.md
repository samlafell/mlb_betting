# MLB Betting System: Observability-First Scheduling & Visibility

## Core Philosophy: Observability Before Complexity
Build comprehensive monitoring and visibility infrastructure first, then add robust scheduling that can scale to distributed execution.

## Phase 1: Production-Grade Observability Foundation (Week 1)

### Task 1.1: Comprehensive Metrics Infrastructure ✅
- **Enhanced Prometheus Integration**
  - Instrument existing `PipelineOrchestrationService` with detailed metrics
  - Add custom metrics: pipeline latency percentiles, success rates, data freshness scores
  - Create business-specific metrics: opportunities detected, strategy performance, betting value identified
  - Implement SLI/SLO tracking with automatic alerting thresholds

- **Health Check Enhancement**
  - Upgrade existing health checks with detailed status responses
  - Add break-glass manual override endpoints for emergency control
  - Create dependency health tracking (database, APIs, external services)

### Task 1.2: Production-Ready Structured Logging ⏳
- **Enhanced Logging Architecture**
  - Add execution correlation IDs across all pipeline stages
  - Implement structured JSON logging with proper metadata
  - Add performance timing logs for every major operation
  - Create log aggregation preparation (compatible with ELK/Loki)

- **Distributed Tracing Preparation**
  - Add OpenTelemetry instrumentation hooks
  - Create span context for complex pipeline workflows
  - Implement request correlation across service boundaries

### Task 1.3: Real-Time Dashboard Infrastructure
- **FastAPI Monitoring Service**
  - Build dedicated monitoring API with WebSocket support for real-time updates
  - Create detailed execution history and error tracking endpoints
  - Add system health visualization APIs
  - Implement authentication and role-based access for production use

## Phase 2: Enterprise-Grade APScheduler (Week 2)

### Task 2.1: Production APScheduler Configuration
- **Robust Scheduler Setup**
  ```python
  scheduler = AsyncIOScheduler(
      jobstores={'default': SQLAlchemyJobStore(url='postgresql://...', tablename='scheduled_jobs')},
      executors={
          'default': ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4),
          'critical': ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=2)  # Dedicated for critical data collection
      },
      job_defaults={
          'coalesce': True,          # Prevent job pileup during outages
          'max_instances': 1,        # One instance per job type
          'misfire_grace_time': 30,  # Allow 30s late execution
          'replace_existing': True   # Handle job updates gracefully
      }
  )
  ```

### Task 2.2: Resilient Job Management
- **Failure-Resistant Execution**
  - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff (3 attempts, 30s/60s/120s delays)
  - Add circuit breaker pattern for persistently failing jobs
  - Create job health monitoring with automatic restart capabilities
  - Implement job dependency management (data collection → analysis → recommendations)

- **Break-Glass Emergency Procedures**
  - Manual override system bypassing scheduler for critical operations
  - Emergency data collection endpoints with direct database access
  - Fallback to CLI execution with full logging integration
  - Database-driven job queue as scheduler backup mechanism

## Phase 3: Scale-Ready Architecture (Week 3)

### Task 3.1: Future-Proof Abstraction Layer
- **Task Executor Interface**
  ```python
  class TaskExecutor(ABC):
      @abstractmethod
      async def execute_pipeline(self, pipeline_type: str, **kwargs) -> PipelineResult
      
  class APSchedulerExecutor(TaskExecutor):    # Current implementation
  class CeleryExecutor(TaskExecutor):        # Future Redis/Celery implementation
  ```

- **Migration-Ready Design**
  - Abstract task interface compatible with both APScheduler and Celery
  - Message serialization format that maps to Redis data structures
  - Job metadata structure compatible with Celery task signatures
  - Configuration system supporting both local and distributed execution

### Task 3.2: Container and Scale Preparation
- **Docker Integration**
  - Docker-compose setup for local development with Redis/Celery services ready
  - Environment-based configuration for easy production scaling
  - Health check endpoints compatible with container orchestration
  - Graceful shutdown handling for zero-downtime deployments

- **Distributed Execution Readiness**
  - Worker pool abstraction that scales from threads to processes to distributed workers
  - Queue management that works with both local and Redis backends
  - Load balancing preparation for multiple worker nodes

## Observability-First Success Metrics

### Critical SLIs to Track Immediately
- **Pipeline Performance**: P99 data collection latency < 30 seconds
- **System Reliability**: 99.5% successful pipeline execution rate  
- **Business Impact**: 95% opportunity detection within 60 seconds of data availability
- **Resource Efficiency**: <10% additional system overhead from monitoring

### Break-Glass Scenarios
- **APScheduler failure** → Automatic fallback to CLI-based execution with full logging
- **Database connectivity loss** → Local SQLite job store with automatic recovery
- **System resource exhaustion** → Automatic job throttling and priority-based execution
- **External API failures** → Graceful degradation with comprehensive alerting

## Technical Benefits
- **Immediate Production Readiness**: Full observability from day one
- **Zero Infrastructure Debt**: Built on existing PostgreSQL and monitoring services
- **Seamless Scaling Path**: Direct migration to Celery/Redis when needed
- **Operational Excellence**: Comprehensive break-glass procedures and emergency controls
