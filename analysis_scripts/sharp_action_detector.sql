-- Sharp Action Detection Strategy
-- Identifies when stake % significantly exceeds bet % (indicating larger average bet sizes)
-- This typically suggests "sharp" or professional money is on that side
--
-- DEDUPLICATION APPROACH:
-- This script preserves ALL line movement data for analysis but implements 
-- recommendation-level deduplication to ensure only ONE final bet per game per market.
-- Final recommendations use data closest to 5 minutes before first pitch.
