ADAPTIVE MASTER BETTING DETECTOR
===============================

Intelligently combines all validated betting strategies using:
‚úÖ Dynamic thresholds optimized by backtesting results
‚úÖ Only strategies currently performing above break-even
‚úÖ Automatic configuration updates every 15 minutes
‚úÖ Performance-based confidence levels

This detector learns from its own performance and adapts over time.

Usage: uv run analysis_scripts/master_betting_detector.py --minutes 300
