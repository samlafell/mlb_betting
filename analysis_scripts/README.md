# Analysis Scripts Directory - CONSOLIDATED ARCHITECTURE

## üéØ NEW ARCHITECTURE (Post-Consolidation)

**SINGLE ENTRY POINT:** All betting analysis now flows through `master_betting_detector.py`

### CLI Commands:
```bash
# üéØ PRIMARY COMMAND - All betting opportunities
uv run python -m mlb_sharp_betting.cli detect-opportunities --minutes 300

# ü§ñ Strategy Management  
uv run python -m mlb_sharp_betting.cli show-active-strategies
uv run python -m mlb_sharp_betting.cli auto-integrate-strategies

# üìä Performance Analysis
uv run python -m mlb_sharp_betting.cli performance --date 2024-01-15
```

## üìÅ FOLDER CONTENTS

### ‚úÖ SQL Strategy Files (KEEP)
These files define the mathematical logic for each betting strategy:
- `*_strategy_postgres.sql` - All strategy SQL files
- `sharp_action_detector_postgres.sql` - Sharp action detection logic
- `signal_combinations_postgres.sql` - Signal combination analysis

### üî• ORCHESTRATOR SYSTEM (PHASE 3)
- Phase 3 Orchestrator provides **UNIFIED STRATEGY EXECUTION** for all betting analysis
  - ‚úÖ Strategy performance feedback loop (backtesting ‚Üí live detection)
  - ‚úÖ Dynamic threshold adjustment based on ROI
  - ‚úÖ Unified processor architecture (same logic in backtesting and live)
  - ‚úÖ Adaptive confidence scoring with performance weighting
  - ‚úÖ Ensemble conflict resolution for competing signals
  - ‚úÖ Automatic poor strategy filtering

### ‚ùå DEPRECATED FILES (TO REMOVE)
These files are now redundant since all logic is in master detector:
- `opposing_markets_detector.py` - Logic moved to master detector
- `validated_betting_detector.py` - Logic moved to master detector
- `demo_betting_finder.py` - Replaced by CLI commands
- Other standalone Python detection scripts

## üßπ CLEANUP PLAN

1. **Keep**: All `*.sql` files (strategy definitions)
2. **Keep**: Phase 3 Orchestrator system (unified strategy execution)
3. **Remove**: All other `*.py` files (redundant detectors)
4. **Update**: Master detector to include ALL strategy logic

## üí° USAGE PHILOSOPHY

- **SQL files** = Strategy mathematical definitions
- **Orchestrator** = Performance-driven adaptive execution engine for all strategies
- **CLI** = User interface for all betting analysis
- **No script proliferation** = One controller rules them all

## ‚ö° Quick Start

```bash
# Find all betting opportunities (replaces all other detectors)
uv run python -m mlb_sharp_betting.cli detect-opportunities

# Show what strategies are currently active
uv run python -m mlb_sharp_betting.cli show-active-strategies

# Auto-integrate new profitable strategies
uv run python -m mlb_sharp_betting.cli auto-integrate-strategies
```

## üéØ BENEFITS OF CONSOLIDATION

1. **Single Source of Truth** - No confusion about which detector to use
2. **Unified Strategy Integration** - All strategies flow through one pipeline
3. **Consistent Confidence Scoring** - Same scoring logic for all strategies
4. **Centralized Juice Filtering** - No duplicate filtering logic
5. **Easier Maintenance** - Update logic in one place
6. **CLI Integration** - Professional command interface
7. **JSON Output Support** - Structured data export for automation

**üö® MIGRATION STATUS: COMPLETE**
All detection logic evolved into Phase 3 Orchestrator system with performance feedback loops.

# MLB Sharp Betting Analysis Scripts

This directory contains comprehensive analysis scripts for identifying profitable MLB betting strategies using betting splits data combined with game outcomes.

## üìä Overview

Our analysis combines **line movement patterns** with **sharp action detection** to identify edges in MLB betting markets. We analyze when professional money (indicated by stake percentage exceeding bet percentage) aligns with line movement to find profitable betting opportunities.

## üéØ **BETTING OPPORTUNITY FINDERS** (Production Tools)

### **PRIMARY TOOL: `validated_betting_detector.py`** ‚≠ê
**The main production tool for finding betting opportunities**
```bash
# Find opportunities in games starting within 5 minutes
uv run analysis_scripts/validated_betting_detector.py --minutes 5

# Look further ahead (e.g., 4 hours)  
uv run analysis_scripts/validated_betting_detector.py --minutes 240
```

**Key Features:**
- ‚úÖ **Correct timezone handling** (fixes SQL timezone bugs)
- ‚úÖ **Validated strategies only** (proven profitable through backtesting)
- ‚úÖ **No duplicates** (one recommendation per game/source/book)
- ‚úÖ **VSIN signals ‚â•15%** differential (proven profitable)
- ‚úÖ **SBD signals ‚â•25%** differential (higher threshold due to lower performance)
- ‚úÖ **Estimated win rates** and ROI calculations

### **DEMO TOOL: `demo_betting_finder.py`** üéÆ
**Educational tool showing how the system works**
```bash
# See a demonstration of how betting opportunities are detected
uv run analysis_scripts/demo_betting_finder.py
```

**Purpose:**
- Creates safe demo data to show system functionality
- Good for onboarding new users
- Demonstrates signal detection without real betting data
- Cleans up demo data automatically

## üîÑ **RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW**

```bash
# 1. Collect current betting splits data (run every 15-30 minutes)
uv run src/mlb_sharp_betting/entrypoint.py --sportsbook circa

# 2. Find validated opportunities (within 5 minutes of game time)
uv run analysis_scripts/validated_betting_detector.py --minutes 5

# 3. Act on HIGH confidence signals immediately
# 4. Verify odds at your sportsbook before betting
```

## üìà **BACKTESTING & ANALYSIS SCRIPTS** (SQL-based)

*These scripts analyze historical data to validate strategies and understand market patterns*

### 1. `line_movement_strategy.sql`
**Purpose**: Analyzes line movement patterns and their predictive value
- Tracks opening vs closing lines across different bet types
- Categories line movement magnitude (big, medium, small moves)
- Tests both "follow the movement" and "fade the movement" strategies
- **Key Insight**: Big line movements (‚â•10 points) often indicate informed money

### 2. `sharp_action_detector.sql` 
**Purpose**: Identifies when professional money is on one side of a bet
- Detects when stake % significantly exceeds bet % (indicating larger average bets)
- Categories sharp action strength: Strong (‚â•15%), Moderate (‚â•10%), Weak (‚â•5%)
- Analyzes timing of sharp action (early vs late)
- **Key Insight**: Strong differentials (‚â•15%) typically indicate professional involvement

### 3. `hybrid_line_sharp_strategy.sql`
**Purpose**: Combines line movement with sharp action for confirmation
- Identifies when line movement and sharp action align (confirmation)
- Detects conflicting signals between line movement and money flow
- Categories: Strong Confirmation, Steam Plays, Public Moves, Reverse Line Movement
- **Key Insight**: Best results when both indicators agree on direction

### 4. `timing_based_strategy.sql`
**Purpose**: Analyzes the timing of sharp action and line movement
- Compares early persistent sharp action vs late developing action
- Identifies "steam moves" (last-minute professional action)
- Tests whether early or late sharp action is more predictive
- **Key Insight**: Timing of sharp action affects reliability

### 5. `strategy_comparison_roi.sql`
**Purpose**: Comprehensive comparison of all strategies with detailed ROI calculations
- Compares performance across different approaches
- Calculates ROI for $100 unit bets at various odds (-110, -105)
- Includes Kelly Criterion recommendations for bet sizing

### 6. `executive_summary_report.sql`
**Purpose**: High-level executive summary with actionable recommendations
- Data quality assessment and market coverage analysis
- Key insights and strategy effectiveness summary
- Specific actionable recommendations with risk management
- **Key Insight**: Executive-level decision making framework

### 7. `total_line_sweet_spots_strategy.sql` ‚≠ê **NEW**
**Purpose**: Identifies value around key total numbers (7.5, 8.5, 9.5)
- Analyzes public bias patterns at psychologically important total lines
- Tests Over performance when public heavily on Under at key numbers
- Detects sharp money disagreement with public at sweet spots
- **Key Insight**: Public often over-reacts to key total thresholds

### 8. `underdog_ml_value_strategy.sql` ‚≠ê **NEW**
**Purpose**: Systematic underdog value when public loves favorites
- Identifies ML underdog opportunities when public heavily favors favorites
- Combines with spread betting disagreement for enhanced value spots
- Tests value at different odds ranges (small dogs vs big dogs)
- **Key Insight**: Public consistently overvalues favorites, creating dog value

### 9. `team_specific_bias_strategy.sql` ‚≠ê **NEW**
**Purpose**: Team-specific public bias analysis
- Tracks which teams consistently get overbet/underbet by public
- Identifies large market bias (Yankees, Dodgers) vs small market value
- Combines team bias with sharp money confirmation
- **Key Insight**: Popular teams often overvalued, small market teams undervalued

## üéØ **RUNNING THE NEW PHASE 1 STRATEGIES**

### Test the New Strategies
```bash
# Test total line sweet spots
psql -h localhost -d mlb_betting -f < analysis_scripts/total_line_sweet_spots_strategy.sql

# Test underdog ML value  
psql -h localhost -d mlb_betting -f < analysis_scripts/underdog_ml_value_strategy.sql

# Test team-specific bias
psql -h localhost -d mlb_betting -f < analysis_scripts/team_specific_bias_strategy.sql
```

### Run All Phase 1 Strategies Together
```bash
# Create combined Phase 1 analysis
cat analysis_scripts/total_line_sweet_spots_strategy.sql \
    analysis_scripts/underdog_ml_value_strategy.sql \
    analysis_scripts/team_specific_bias_strategy.sql | \
    psql -h localhost -d mlb_betting -f
```

## üè¶ ROI Calculations

All strategies calculate ROI assuming standard betting odds:
- **-110 odds**: Risk $110 to win $100 (standard juice)
- **-105 odds**: Risk $105 to win $100 (reduced juice)
- **Break-even rate**: 52.38% at -110 odds, 51.22% at -105 odds

### ROI Formula
```
ROI = (Wins √ó Payout) - (Losses √ó Risk)
ROI Percentage = ROI / Total Risk √ó 100
```

## üìà Strategy Classifications

### Sharp Action Levels
- **Strong Sharp**: Stake % - Bet % ‚â• 15% (highest confidence)
- **Moderate Sharp**: Stake % - Bet % ‚â• 10% (good confidence)  
- **Weak Sharp**: Stake % - Bet % ‚â• 5% (low confidence)

### Line Movement Categories
- **Big Movement**: ‚â•10 points (significant market adjustment)
- **Medium Movement**: 5-9 points (moderate adjustment)
- **Small Movement**: 1-4 points (minor adjustment)

### Hybrid Strategy Types
- **Strong Confirmation**: Big line movement + strong sharp action (same direction)
- **Steam Play**: Strong sharp action without significant line movement
- **Public Move**: Big line movement without sharp confirmation
- **Reverse Line Movement**: Line moves opposite to public money

## üé≤ How to Run Analysis

### Option 1: Run Individual Scripts
```bash
# Connect to your PostgreSQL database and execute any script
psql -h localhost -d mlb_betting -f < analysis_scripts/line_movement_strategy.sql
```

### Option 2: Comprehensive Analysis (Recommended)
```bash
# Run all analyses with detailed reporting
uv run python run_comprehensive_analysis.py
```

This will:
- Execute all 9 analysis scripts in sequence
- Generate detailed console output with results
- Save results to CSV files in `analysis_results/` directory
- Create comprehensive log in `analysis_results.log`

## üìã Required Database Schema

The scripts expect these tables in your PostgreSQL database:
