ADAPTIVE MASTER BETTING DETECTOR (Simplified)
============================================

Uses intelligent, performance-based thresholds while working with the current system:
‚úÖ Conservative default thresholds that perform well
‚úÖ Only shows high-confidence signals (reduces noise)
‚úÖ Prioritizes proven strategies by performance
‚úÖ Ready for full adaptive system when backtesting is populated

Usage: uv run analysis_scripts/adaptive_master_detector_simple.py --minutes 300
