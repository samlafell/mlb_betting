Integration tests for Pipeline Observability

Tests the integration of all Phase 1 observability components working together:
- PipelineOrchestrationService with metrics and logging integration
- Prometheus metrics recording during pipeline execution
- Enhanced logging with correlation tracking through pipeline stages
- System state analysis with proper metrics and logging coordination
- Error scenarios with comprehensive metrics and logging
- Performance impact verification (<10% overhead)
