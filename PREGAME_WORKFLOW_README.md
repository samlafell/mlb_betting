# MLB Pre-Game Workflow System

Automated three-stage workflow system that triggers 5 minutes before each MLB game to collect betting data, perform sharp action analysis, and send email notifications with results.

## üéØ Overview

This system provides a completely automated workflow that:
1. **Stage 1: Pre-Game Data Collection** - Triggers main entrypoint program for betting data collection
2. **Stage 2: Betting Analysis** - Executes sharp action detection with adaptive thresholds
3. **Stage 3: Automated Notification** - Sends email with results including text output and analysis files

### Key Features

- ‚úÖ **Separate Scheduler** - Independent from existing hourly data collection
- ‚úÖ **3 Retry Attempts** - With exponential backoff for failed stages
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Error Handling** - Proper logging and timeout handling
- ‚úÖ **Email Notifications** - Gmail SMTP with HTML/plain text for mobile reading
- ‚úÖ **File Attachments** - Analysis results included in emails
- ‚úÖ **Success & Failure Notifications** - Complete workflow visibility
- ‚úÖ **Preserves Existing Systems** - Hourly data collection and daily setup unchanged

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Email Configuration

First, configure Gmail for notifications:

```bash
# Interactive email setup
uv run python src/mlb_sharp_betting/cli.py pregame configure-email

# Or set environment variables manually
export EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="your-gmail@gmail.com"
export EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD="your-gmail-app-password" 
export EMAIL_TO_ADDRESSES="recipient1@email.com,recipient2@email.com"
```

**Gmail Setup Requirements:**
1. Enable 2-factor authentication on your Gmail account
2. Generate an App Password at: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
3. Use the generated App Password (not your regular password)

### 2. Start the Scheduler

```bash
# Start the pre-game workflow scheduler
./start_pregame_scheduler.sh

# Or use the CLI directly
uv run python src/mlb_sharp_betting/cli.py pregame start
```

The scheduler will:
- Check for MLB games daily at 6 AM EST
- Schedule workflows 5 minutes before each game
- Send email notifications with results

### 3. Monitor and Control

```bash
# Check scheduler status
./start_pregame_scheduler.sh --status
uv run python src/mlb_sharp_betting/cli.py pregame status

# View live logs
tail -f pregame_scheduler.log

# Stop the scheduler
./stop_pregame_scheduler.sh

# Restart the scheduler
./start_pregame_scheduler.sh --restart
```

## üìã Available Commands

### Scheduler Management

```bash
# Start scheduler with custom settings
uv run python src/mlb_sharp_betting/cli.py pregame start \

## üõ† Architecture

### Components

1. **PreGameWorkflowService** (`src/mlb_sharp_betting/services/pre_game_workflow.py`)
   - Orchestrates the three-stage workflow
   - Handles retry logic and error recovery
   - Generates and sends email notifications
   - Manages file attachments

2. **PreGameScheduler** (`src/mlb_sharp_betting/services/pre_game_scheduler.py`)
   - Monitors MLB games and schedules workflows
   - Runs daily game setup at 6 AM EST
   - Manages workflow job queue
   - Provides status and metrics APIs

3. **CLI Commands** (`src/mlb_sharp_betting/cli/commands/pre_game.py`)
   - Command-line interface for all operations
   - Interactive email configuration
   - Status monitoring and troubleshooting
   - Testing and development tools

### Workflow Stages

#### Stage 1: Data Collection (3 retries, exponential backoff)
```bash
uv run python -m mlb_sharp_betting.entrypoint
```
- Triggers main data collection pipeline
- Collects VSIN and SBD betting splits
- Stores data in DuckDB database
- Timeout: 180 seconds

#### Stage 2: Betting Analysis (3 retries, exponential backoff)
```bash
uv run analysis_scripts/master_betting_detector.py --minutes 5
```
- Executes adaptive sharp action detection
- Analyzes recent betting line movements
- Generates comprehensive analysis report
- Timeout: 300 seconds

#### Stage 3: Email Notification (1 retry)
- Compiles workflow results
- Generates HTML and plain text emails
- Attaches analysis files
- Sends via Gmail SMTP
- Timeout: 60 seconds

## üìä Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### Log Files

```bash
# Scheduler logs
tail -f pregame_scheduler.log

# Individual workflow logs (timestamped)
ls -la workflow_logs/workflow_*.log

# System logs
tail -f analysis_results.log
```

### Status Checking

```bash
# Comprehensive status
uv run python src/mlb_sharp_betting/cli.py pregame status

# Shows:
# - Running status
# - Email configuration status
# - Scheduled games for today
# - Active workflow jobs
# - Completed workflows count
# - Recent workflow history
# - Performance metrics
```

### Common Issues

#### Email Not Configured
```bash
# Error: Email settings not configured
# Solution: Run email setup
uv run python src/mlb_sharp_betting/cli.py pregame configure-email
```

#### Scheduler Not Starting
```bash
# Check dependencies
uv sync

# Check if already running
./start_pregame_scheduler.sh --status

# Force restart
./start_pregame_scheduler.sh --restart
```

#### Stage Failures
```bash
# Check specific stage logs
tail -f pregame_scheduler.log | grep "Stage"

# Test individual stages
uv run python src/mlb_sharp_betting/cli.py pregame test-workflow
```

#### No Games Detected
```bash
# Verify MLB API connection
uv run python src/mlb_sharp_betting/cli.py pregame list-games

# Check timezone settings
echo $MLB_TIMEZONE
```

## üîê Security Notes

### Email Credentials
- Use Gmail App Passwords, not regular passwords
- Store credentials in environment variables, not code
- Consider using `.env` file for local development
- Never commit credentials to version control

### File Permissions
```bash
# Secure the startup script
chmod 700 start_pregame_scheduler.sh

# Secure log files (optional)
chmod 600 pregame_scheduler.log
```

### Network Security
- Scheduler runs locally, no external ports opened
- Email uses Gmail's secure SMTP (TLS)
- API calls use HTTPS endpoints

## üß™ Testing

### Test Complete Workflow
```bash
# Test with today's first game
uv run python src/mlb_sharp_betting/cli.py pregame test-workflow

# Test with specific game
uv run python src/mlb_sharp_betting/cli.py pregame test-workflow --game-pk 746234

# Dry run (no emails sent)
DISABLE_EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS=true uv run python src/mlb_sharp_betting/cli.py pregame test-workflow
```

### Test Individual Components
```bash
# Test data collection
uv run python -m mlb_sharp_betting.entrypoint

# Test analysis
uv run analysis_scripts/master_betting_detector.py --minutes 5

# Test email configuration
python -c "
from mlb_sharp_betting.services.alert_service import AlertService
alert = AlertService()
print('Email configured:', alert.is_configured())
"
```

### Mock Testing
```bash
# Use mock data for testing
MOCK_MODE=true uv run python src/mlb_sharp_betting/cli.py pregame test-workflow
```

## üìà Performance

### Resource Usage
- Memory: ~50-100MB typical usage
- CPU: Low, spikes during workflow execution
- Disk: Log files grow over time (consider rotation)
- Network: Minimal, only during API calls and email

### Scaling Considerations
- Single scheduler instance per project
- Supports multiple concurrent workflows
- Database locks handled automatically
- Email rate limiting respected

### Optimization Tips
```bash
# Reduce log verbosity for production
export LOG_LEVEL=WARNING

# Cleanup old workflow logs
find workflow_logs/ -name "*.log" -mtime +30 -delete

# Monitor database size
psql -h localhost -d mlb_betting -c "\dt+"
```

## ü§ù Integration

### Existing Systems
The pre-game workflow system is designed to complement existing systems:

- **Hourly Data Collection**: Continues unchanged
- **Daily Game Updates**: Preserved and enhanced
- **Alert Service**: Shared and enhanced with new email templates
- **Database**: Same DuckDB instance, no conflicts

### Custom Workflows
```python
# Create custom workflow stages
from mlb_sharp_betting.services.pre_game_workflow import PreGameWorkflowService

workflow = PreGameWorkflowService()

# Add custom stage
async def custom_analysis_stage():
    # Your custom analysis logic
    pass

# Execute with custom stages
await workflow.execute_custom_workflow(game, [custom_analysis_stage])
```

## üìù Development

### Adding New Features

1. **New CLI Commands**: Add to `src/mlb_sharp_betting/cli/commands/pre_game.py`
2. **New Workflow Stages**: Modify `PreGameWorkflowService.execute_pre_game_workflow()`
3. **New Email Templates**: Update `_generate_email_content()` method
4. **New Metrics**: Add to scheduler's metrics collection
