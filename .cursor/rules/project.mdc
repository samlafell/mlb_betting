[python]
Use UV over PIP
- we should always use "uv run" instead of "python" to run programs

Use Ruff to format Python code

Python
DuckDB - not SQLite
MLB-StatsAPI is available at [mlb_stats_api_endpoints.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/mlb_stats_api_endpoints.mdc) if we need official MLB data for games

[duckdb]
Concurrency issues are common - Singleton method with a DB Coordinator is the way we handle this.

Use the database coordinator anywhere we need database access:

```python
from mlb_sharp_betting.services.database_coordinator import get_database_coordinator

coordinator = get_database_coordinator()
result = coordinator.execute_read(query, parameters)
```

When you want to filter a column to a value and that value is a VARCHAR, you must use single quotes (col = 'me') and not double quotes (col = "me") because this method of filtering will cause an error.

Always use Context7 to get updated documentation for any tools we are using

When you update one file, if that causes a breaking change in another file, please make the updates

When you make changes to a file 2 times, on the 3rd time you go to make a change: explain in detail why that change is the right change. And evaluate your own statement to see if it makes sense.

From root dir, the project code files are at: ./src/mlb_sharp_betting/

Always use rules files when able, especially [pydantic.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/pydantic.mdc)

When we need official data for a baseball game (time, weather, location, lineups), use [mlb_stats_api_endpoints.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/mlb_stats_api_endpoints.mdc)

Put simply: MLB APIs give times in UTC but I want all references to times in EST
