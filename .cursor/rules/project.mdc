[python]
Use UV over PIP
- we should always use "uv run" instead of "python" to run programs

Use Ruff to format Python code


[stack]
Python
DuckDB - not SQLite
MLB-StatsAPI is available at [mlb_stats_api_endpoints.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/mlb_stats_api_endpoints.mdc) if we need official MLB data for games

Always use Context7 to get updated documentation for any tools we are using

When you update one file, if that causes a breaking change in another file, please make the updates

When you make changes to a file 2 times, on the 3rd time you go to make a change: explain in detail why that change is the right change. And evaluate your own statement to see if it makes sense.

From root dir, the project code files are at: ./src/mlb_sharp_betting/

Always use rules files when able, especially [pydantic.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/pydantic.mdc)

When we need official data for a baseball game (time, weather, location, lineups), use [mlb_stats_api_endpoints.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/mlb_stats_api_endpoints.mdc)
