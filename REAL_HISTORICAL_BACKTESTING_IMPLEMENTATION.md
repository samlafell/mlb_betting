# Real Historical Data Backtesting Implementation

## Overview

The backtesting service has been upgraded from mock data to real historical game outcome evaluation. This implementation provides accurate strategy performance assessment using actual MLB game results.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Real Game Outcome Integration

**Before**: Mock data with hardcoded results
```python
mock_result = BacktestResult(
    strategy_name=self.processor_name,
    total_bets=45,  # Realistic sample size
    wins=25,
    win_rate=0.556,
    roi_per_100=12.5,
    confidence_score=0.78,
    sample_size_category="RELIABLE"
)
```

**After**: Real historical data evaluation
```python
# Step 1: Get historical games with outcomes in date range
historical_games = await self._get_historical_games(start_date, end_date)

# Step 2: For each game, simulate what the processor would have recommended
processor_signals = []
for game in historical_games:
    betting_data = await self._get_actionable_betting_data(game['game_id'], game['game_datetime'])
    signals = await self._run_processor_on_historical_data(game, betting_data)
    processor_signals.extend(signals)

# Step 3: Evaluate signals against actual game outcomes
backtest_results = await self._evaluate_signals_against_outcomes(processor_signals)
```

### 2. Actionable Data Window

The system now respects realistic betting windows:
- Only uses betting data available within 45 minutes of game time
- Excludes data collected less than 30 seconds before game time
- Ensures recommendations could have actually been placed

### 3. Game Outcome Repository Integration

- Uses existing `GameOutcomeRepository` for real game data
- Queries `public.game_outcomes` table for actual scores
- Evaluates moneyline, over/under, and spread bets against real results

### 4. Enhanced Processor Simulations

#### Sharp Action Processor
```python
async def _simulate_sharp_action_analysis(self, game: Dict, bet_record: Dict) -> Optional[Dict]:
    # Calculate bet/money differential (key indicator for sharp action)
    home_bet_pct = bet_record.get('home_or_over_bets_percentage', 50.0)
    home_money_pct = bet_record.get('home_or_over_stake_percentage', 50.0)
    
    differential = abs(home_bet_pct - home_money_pct)
    
    # Apply realistic thresholds
    if differential >= 20.0:  # Strong sharp action
        confidence = 0.85
        signal_strength = "STRONG"
    elif differential >= 15.0:  # Moderate sharp action
        confidence = 0.70
        signal_strength = "MODERATE"
    # ... etc
```

#### Public Fade Processor
```python
async def _simulate_public_fade_analysis(self, game: Dict, bet_record: Dict) -> Optional[Dict]:
    # Look for heavily public sides (80%+ public backing)
    if home_bet_pct >= 80.0:  # Public heavily on home
        recommended_bet = "AWAY_ML"  # Fade the public
        bet_target = game['away_team']
        confidence = 0.65
    # ... etc
```

### 5. Realistic Bet Evaluation

The system now:
- Calculates actual win/loss based on real game scores
- Uses realistic -110 odds for profit/loss calculations
- Tracks moneyline, over/under, and spread betting outcomes
- Aggregates individual bet results into strategy performance metrics

### 6. Database Manager Integration

- Updated executor registration to pass database manager
- Proper connection handling and resource cleanup
- Integration with existing PostgreSQL database structure

## Technical Architecture

### ProcessorStrategyExecutor Flow

1. **Historical Games Query**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT 
       go.game_id, go.home_team, go.away_team,
       go.game_date, go.home_score, go.away_score,
       go.home_win, go.over
   FROM public.game_outcomes go
   WHERE go.game_date BETWEEN %s AND %s
     AND go.home_score IS NOT NULL 
     AND go.away_score IS NOT NULL
   ```

2. **Actionable Betting Data**
   ```sql
   SELECT source_book_type, split_type,
       home_or_over_bets_percentage,
       home_or_over_stake_percentage,
       line_or_total, last_updated
   FROM splits.raw_mlb_betting_splits
   WHERE game_id = %s
     AND EXTRACT('epoch' FROM (%s - last_updated)) / 60 <= 45  -- Within 45 min
   ```

3. **Outcome Evaluation**
   ```python
   def _evaluate_bet_outcome(self, signal: Dict, game_outcome: Dict) -> bool:
       if recommended_bet == "HOME_ML":
           return home_score > away_score
       elif recommended_bet == "AWAY_ML":
           return away_score > home_score
       # ... etc
   ```

## Sample Size Categories

The system categorizes strategy reliability:
- **INSUFFICIENT**: < 10 bets
- **BASIC**: 10-24 bets
- **RELIABLE**: 25-49 bets  
- **ROBUST**: 50+ bets

## Performance Metrics

Real calculations now include:
- **ROI per $100 wagered**: Based on actual profit/loss
- **Win Rate**: Actual wins divided by total bets
- **Confidence Score**: Average processor confidence for signals
- **Sample Size**: Real bet count from historical analysis

## Usage Example

```python
# Initialize service with real data
service = SimplifiedBacktestingService(db_manager)
await service.initialize()

# Run backtest with actual game outcomes
results = await service.run_backtest("2024-01-01", "2024-12-31")

# Get real performance metrics
for result in results['results']:
    print(f"{result.strategy_name}: {result.roi_per_100:.1f}% ROI")
    print(f"  {result.total_bets} bets, {result.win_rate:.1%} win rate")
    print(f"  Sample category: {result.sample_size_category}")
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Additional Processor Implementations**
   - Complete book conflict analysis
   - Implement late flip detection
   - Add opposing markets logic

2. **Advanced Metrics**
   - Sharpe ratio calculation
   - Maximum drawdown tracking
   - Statistical significance testing

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Batch processing for large date ranges
   - Caching of historical game data
   - Parallel processor execution

## Testing

Run the demo to verify the implementation:
```bash
uv run examples/refactored_backtesting_demo.py
```

This will show real historical backtesting results and demonstrate the accuracy improvements over the previous mock data approach.

## Summary

The backtesting service now provides:
- ✅ Real game outcome evaluation
- ✅ Actionable betting window compliance
- ✅ Accurate profit/loss calculations
- ✅ Realistic strategy performance metrics
- ✅ Integration with existing game outcome repository
- ✅ Backward compatibility with legacy interfaces

This implementation moves the system from theoretical to practical betting strategy evaluation based on actual historical performance.
