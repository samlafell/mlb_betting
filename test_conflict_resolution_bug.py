Test Script: Conflict Resolution Bug Analysis
===========================================

This script demonstrates the bug where PHI ML (+2% differential) 
is being selected over HOU -1.5 (-22% differential) despite the
latter being clearly stronger.

The issue appears to be in the conflict resolution logic or display.
