# Refactoring Plan: `sportsbookreview` Project

Based on the initial architecture and expert feedback, this plan outlines the evolution of the `sportsbookreview` project into a production-grade data collection pipeline.

---

### Phase 1: Foundational Enhancements & Robustness
*Strengthen the core components to handle failures and improve data quality.*

*   **Task 1.1: Implement Advanced Error Handling & Circuit Breaker**
    *   **Goal:** Introduce a Circuit Breaker pattern in the `SportsbookReviewScraper` to prevent repeated calls to a failing service, making the scraper more resilient.

*   **Task 1.2: Enhance Data Validation**
    *   **Goal:** Bolster the `SportsbookReviewParser` by adding comprehensive schema and business rule validation to ensure higher data quality downstream.

*   **Task 1.3: Introduce a Staging Area**
    *   **Goal:** Modify the `DataStorageService` to save raw and parsed data into a staging area in the database, creating an audit trail and allowing for reprocessing.

---

### Phase 2: Performance and Scalability
*Introduce components to manage load, handle concurrent operations, and improve performance.*


*   **Task 2.2: Develop an Adaptive Rate Limiter**
    *   **Goal:** Create and integrate an advanced, adaptive rate limiter to manage requests to external sites, avoiding blocks and respecting usage policies.

---

### Phase 3: Intelligence and Seamless Integration
*Add sophisticated features for data quality and ensure smooth integration with the main project.*

*   **Task 3.1: Build an Intelligent Scraper and Parser Factory**
    *   **Goal:** Enhance the scraper to handle anti-bot measures (e.g., user-agent rotation). Create a `ParserFactory` to dynamically select the correct parser for different page structures.

*   **Task 3.2: Develop Data Quality & Deduplication Services**
    *   **Goal:** Create services for data cleaning, handling missing values, and deduplicating records before data enters the main system.

*   **Task 3.3: Create a Unified Integration Service**
    *   **Goal:** Build a dedicated service to standardize and map collected data to the main project's data models and publish events for real-time updates.

---

### Phase 4: Monitoring and Observability
*Implement tools to monitor the health and performance of the data collection pipeline.*

*   **Task 4.1: Integrate Monitoring and Alerting**
    *   **Goal:** Add a metrics collector (e.g., Prometheus) to track scraper success rates, processing times, and error patterns. Set up a dashboard (e.g., Grafana) and an alerting system for failures.
