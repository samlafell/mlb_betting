# üîê Security Guidelines & Best Practices

## üö® Critical Security Requirements

### Environment Variables
- **NEVER** commit `.env` files to version control
- **ALWAYS** use strong, unique passwords (minimum 20 characters)
- **ROTATE** passwords regularly in production environments
- **USE** environment variables for all sensitive configuration

### Password Requirements
```bash
# Generate secure passwords
openssl rand -base64 32
# OR
head /dev/urandom | tr -dc A-Za-z0-9 | head -c 32
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Checklist

### Pre-deployment Security Audit
- [ ] All hardcoded passwords removed from code
- [ ] Environment variables properly configured
- [ ] `.env` files excluded from version control
- [ ] Strong passwords generated for all services
- [ ] Database access restricted to application only
- [ ] API endpoints protected with authentication
- [ ] SSL/TLS enabled for production
- [ ] Security headers configured in Nginx
- [ ] Container resource limits set
- [ ] Network isolation configured

### Production Deployment Security
- [ ] Change all default passwords
- [ ] Enable firewall rules
- [ ] Configure monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Set up automated security updates
- [ ] Implement backup encryption
- [ ] Configure log rotation and retention
- [ ] Enable container security scanning

## üîß Secure Configuration

### Docker Compose Security
- Use environment variables for all credentials
- Implement resource limits for all containers
- Configure health checks for all services
- Use specific image tags, not `latest`
- Run containers as non-root users when possible

### Database Security
- Use strong authentication credentials
- Restrict network access to application containers only
- Enable connection encryption (SSL/TLS)
- Regular security updates and patches
- Implement connection pooling and rate limiting

### API Security
- Implement rate limiting
- Use HTTPS in production
- Validate all input parameters
- Implement proper error handling (no sensitive info leakage)
- Use API keys or JWT tokens for authentication

## üö® Incident Response

### Security Breach Response
1. **Immediate**: Rotate all credentials
2. **Assess**: Determine scope of compromise
3. **Contain**: Isolate affected systems
4. **Notify**: Inform stakeholders
5. **Recover**: Restore from secure backups
6. **Learn**: Update security measures
