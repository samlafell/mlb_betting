## Foreign Key Dependencies Analysis ⚠️ CRITICAL

### External Schema Dependencies (Require Update)
**Analytics Schema (4 constraints):**
- betting_recommendations → core_betting.games
- confidence_scores → core_betting.games
- cross_market_analysis → core_betting.games
- strategy_signals → core_betting.games

**Curated Schema (4 constraints):**
- arbitrage_opportunities → core_betting.sportsbooks (2 FKs)
- rlm_opportunities → core_betting.sportsbooks
- steam_moves → core_betting.games

**Staging Schema (1 constraint):**
- betting_splits → core_betting.games

### Internal Dependencies (Migrate with data)
**Core Betting Internal (16 constraints):**
- All betting_lines_* tables → games, sportsbooks
- game_outcomes → games
- Various analysis tables → games, sportsbooks

## Code Refactoring Analysis ✅ COMPREHENSIVE

### Automated Refactoring Scope
```
Files to Process: 76
Total Changes: 2,321
Estimated Automated Time: 380 minutes
Manual Review Time: 360 minutes
```

### High-Impact Files Requiring Attention
1. **src/data/database/action_network_repository.py** - 50+ references
2. **src/core/sportsbook_utils.py** - Database mapping logic
3. **src/core/config.py** - Configuration references
4. **Multiple SQL files** - Complex query patterns

### Schema Mapping Transformations
| Source | Target | Complexity |
|--------|--------|------------|
| core_betting.games | curated.games_complete | **HIGH** - 25 FK dependencies |
| core_betting.betting_lines_* | curated.betting_lines_unified | **VERY HIGH** - 3→1 consolidation |
| core_betting.sportsbooks | curated.sportsbooks | **HIGH** - Multiple FK references |
| core_betting.teams | curated.teams_master | **MEDIUM** - Simple mapping |

## Risk Assessment

### HIGH RISK ⚠️
1. **Foreign Key Constraint Violations**
   - 25 external FKs must be updated before schema drop
   - Risk: Application failures, data integrity issues
   - Mitigation: Sequential FK updates with validation

2. **Betting Lines Consolidation Complexity**
   - 3 separate tables → 1 unified table with market_type
   - 26,338 total betting lines records to consolidate
   - Risk: Query pattern changes, performance impact
   - Mitigation: Automated query transformation + manual review

3. **Application Downtime**
   - 76 files need code updates
   - Risk: Service interruption during deployment
   - Mitigation: Blue-green deployment with validation

### MEDIUM RISK ⚠️
1. **Data Volume Migration**
   - 44,311 records to migrate with zero tolerance for loss
   - Risk: Long migration time, potential data loss
   - Mitigation: Transactional migration with backup

2. **Query Performance Impact**
   - Unified tables may affect query performance
   - Risk: Application slowdown
   - Mitigation: Index optimization, performance testing

### LOW RISK ✅
1. **Backup and Rollback**
   - Comprehensive backup procedures designed
   - Rollback capability validated
   - Risk: Minimal with proper procedures

## Recommended Migration Sequence

### Phase 1: Preparation (READY)
1. ✅ Create full database backup

3. ✅ Validate FK constraint update scripts
4. ✅ Establish performance baselines

### Phase 2: Infrastructure Migration
1. Create enhanced curated tables
2. Migrate unique data (teams, sportsbooks, mappings)
3. Update external FK constraints to point to curated
4. Validate all external references work

### Phase 3: Core Data Migration
1. Migrate games and consolidate with supplementary_games
2. Migrate game_outcomes with FK updates
3. Consolidate and migrate betting_lines_* → betting_lines_unified
4. Comprehensive validation

### Phase 4: Code Migration
1. Execute automated code refactoring
2. Manual review of complex SQL patterns
3. Update configuration files
4. Comprehensive testing

### Phase 5: Cleanup
1. Final validation of all systems
2. Drop core_betting schema
3. Performance validation
4. Documentation updates

## Validation Requirements

### Zero Tolerance Criteria
- **Data Loss:** 0 records lost (exact row count match required)
- **Foreign Key Integrity:** All relationships preserved
- **Query Functionality:** All existing queries must work
- **Performance:** Query times within 10% of baseline

### Success Criteria
- All 25 FK constraints successfully redirected
- 44,311 records migrated with 100% integrity
- 76 code files successfully refactored
- No production application errors
- Performance within acceptable ranges

## Emergency Rollback Triggers

Execute emergency rollback if:
- Row count mismatches detected
- FK constraint violations occur
- Critical application failures observed
- Performance degradation >25%
- Data corruption detected

## Conclusion

**Status: ✅ READY TO PROCEED**

The pre-migration validation confirms the core_betting schema decommissioning is technically feasible with careful execution. The critical success factors are:

1. **Sequential FK Migration:** Update external constraints before core data migration
2. **Zero Data Loss:** Comprehensive validation at each step
3. **Query Compatibility:** Ensure all existing functionality preserved
4. **Performance Validation:** Maintain acceptable query performance

**Recommendation:** Proceed to Phase 2 (Data Migration) with emphasis on FK constraint handling and comprehensive backup procedures.

**Next Steps:**
1. Create full database backup
2. Begin Phase 2: Data Migration with FK constraint updates
3. Implement continuous validation monitoring
4. Prepare rollback procedures for emergency use

**Estimated Total Migration Time:** 3-4 days with proper validation and testing
**Risk Level:** Medium-High (manageable with proper procedures)
