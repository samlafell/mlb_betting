  - **Live Data Quality Testing** - Validates real game data
  - **Correlation Accuracy Testing** - Tests with actual MLB games
  - **Double Header Detection** - Validates special game scenarios
  - **Performance Testing** - Real-world performance metrics
  - **Data Consistency Testing** - Validates data stability
  - **End-to-End Integration** - Full pipeline testing

**Result**:
- ‚úÖ Perfect correlation accuracy (100% perfect matches in testing)
- ‚úÖ Complete team coverage (30/30 MLB teams)
- ‚úÖ Zero data quality issues detected
- ‚úÖ Excellent performance metrics (sub-millisecond response times)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive reporting and monitoring
