## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Components

#### 1. Zone Interface System
```python
# Base zone interface with standardized processing
class BaseZoneProcessor:
    async def process_batch(records) -> ProcessingResult
    async def validate_record(record) -> ValidationResult
    async def health_check() -> HealthStatus
```

**Validation Results**:
- ✅ Interface contracts properly defined
- ✅ Factory pattern implementation working
- ✅ Zone registration system operational
- ✅ Configuration management validated

#### 2. Pipeline Orchestrator
```python
# Multi-zone coordination with metrics
class DataPipelineOrchestrator:
    async def run_full_pipeline() -> PipelineExecution
    async def run_single_zone_pipeline() -> PipelineExecution
    async def get_zone_health() -> Dict[ZoneType, HealthStatus]
```

**Validation Results**:
- ✅ Full pipeline execution (RAW → STAGING → CURATED)
- ✅ Partial pipeline modes (single zone, two-zone combinations)
- ✅ Execution tracking with unique IDs and metrics
- ✅ Error handling and graceful degradation
- ✅ Concurrent execution support validated

#### 3. Data Models (Pydantic v2)
```python
# Modern Pydantic v2 implementation
class DataRecord(BaseModel):
    @field_validator('raw_data')
    @classmethod
    def validate_raw_data(cls, v: Dict[str, Any], info: ValidationInfo) -> Dict[str, Any]
```

**Migration Results**:
- ✅ Complete Pydantic v2 syntax migration
