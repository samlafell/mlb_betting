# Betting Lines Data Quality Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive data quality improvement system for betting lines tables, addressing the critical issues identified in the assessment where 99-100% of sportsbook_id fields were null and sharp action data was completely missing.

## 🚀 What Has Been Implemented

### Phase 1: Critical Infrastructure ✅

#### 1. Sportsbook External Mapping System
**File**: `sql/improvements/01_sportsbook_mapping_system.sql`

- **New Table**: `core_betting.sportsbook_external_mappings`
  - Maps external sportsbook IDs to internal database IDs
  - Supports multiple data sources (ACTION_NETWORK, SPORTSBOOKREVIEW)
  - Pre-populated with common Action Network sportsbook mappings

- **Resolution Function**: `core_betting.resolve_sportsbook_id()`
  - Intelligent sportsbook ID resolution from external identifiers
  - Supports fallback mechanisms for name-based matching
  - Handles multiple data source formats

- **Auto-Resolution Triggers**: Applied to all betting lines tables
  - Automatically resolves sportsbook_id during insert/update
  - Preserves data integrity while fixing mapping issues

#### 2. Enhanced Action Network Repository
**File**: `src/data/database/action_network_repository.py`

- **New Methods**:
  - `resolve_sportsbook_id()`: Uses new mapping system
  - `calculate_data_completeness()`: Scores data quality

- **Improved Data Processing**:
  - Automatic sportsbook ID resolution in all save methods
  - Data completeness scoring for quality assessment
  - Enhanced error handling and logging

### Phase 2: Data Validation & Completeness ✅

#### 1. Comprehensive Data Validation
**File**: `sql/improvements/02_data_validation_and_completeness.sql`

- **New Columns**: Added `data_completeness_score` to all betting lines tables
- **Validation Function**: `core_betting.validate_and_score_betting_lines_data()`
  - Automatic sportsbook ID resolution
  - Real-time data completeness scoring
  - Dynamic data quality classification (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
  - Field validation for reasonable value ranges

#### 2. Data Quality Monitoring Views

- **`core_betting.data_quality_dashboard`**: Overall quality metrics
- **`core_betting.data_quality_trend`**: Historical quality tracking
- **`core_betting.data_source_quality_analysis`**: Source-specific analysis
- **`core_betting.sportsbook_mapping_status`**: Mapping effectiveness metrics

### Phase 3: Sharp Action Integration ✅

#### 1. Sharp Action Detection Service
**File**: `src/services/sharp_action_detection_service.py`

- **Intelligent Integration**: Connects existing strategy processors with data storage
- **Pattern Recognition**: Detects sharp action from strategy analysis results
- **Multi-Market Support**: Handles moneyline, spread, and totals markets
- **Batch Processing**: Processes games by date with configurable options

#### 2. CLI Command Interface
**File**: `src/interfaces/cli/commands/data_quality_improvement.py`

- **Setup Commands**: Deploy infrastructure improvements
- **Sharp Action Updates**: Manual and batch processing
- **Status Monitoring**: Real-time quality assessment
- **Health Checks**: Service availability verification

## 📊 Expected Improvements

### Target Metrics (90 Days Post-Implementation)

| Metric | Before | Target | Method |
|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| **Sportsbook ID Population** | <1% | >95% | Automatic resolution system |
| **Sharp Action Data** | 0% | >60% | Strategy processor integration |
| **Betting Percentage Data** | <1% | >40% | Enhanced data extraction |
| **Overall Data Completeness** | ~20% | >80% | Comprehensive validation |

### Quality Classification

- **HIGH Quality**: Sportsbook ID + 70%+ completeness
- **MEDIUM Quality**: Sportsbook ID + 40%+ completeness OR 60%+ completeness without ID

# Backfill historical data (last 30 days)
uv run -m mlb_sharp_betting.cli.commands.data_quality_improvement backfill-sharp-action
```

### 3. Monitor Data Quality

```bash
# Quick status overview
uv run -m mlb_sharp_betting.cli.commands.data_quality_improvement status
