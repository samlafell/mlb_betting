## üìã IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### 1. Quality Gates System (`src/ml/validation/quality_gates.py`)

**Quality Thresholds Implemented**:
- **Accuracy Thresholds** (Issue #42 Requirements):
  - Moneyline accuracy: ‚â•60% (critical)
  - Spread accuracy: ‚â•58% (critical)  
  - Total accuracy: ‚â•56% (critical)
- **Business Metric Thresholds**:
  - ROI percentage: ‚â•3.0% (critical)
  - Maximum drawdown: ‚â§25.0% (critical)
  - Win rate: ‚â•52.0% (critical)
  - Sharpe ratio: ‚â•0.5 (non-critical)
- **Stability & Performance Thresholds**: Training time, prediction latency, memory usage limits

**Key Features**:
- Configurable threshold system with critical/non-critical classification
- Comprehensive metric validation with pass/fail/warning statuses
- Overall deployment decision logic (block deployment on critical failures)
- Detailed validation summary generation for audit trails

### 2. Business Metrics Validator (`src/ml/validation/business_metrics_validator.py`)

**Capabilities**:
- **ROI Calculation**: Complete betting simulation with vig consideration (4.5% standard vig rate)
- **Risk Metrics**: Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, volatility calculation
- **Performance Tracking**: Win rate, bet frequency, accuracy on placed bets
- **Kelly Criterion**: Optimal bet sizing calculation for risk management
- **Betting Strategy Simulation**: Complete bankroll management simulation

**Validation Logic**:
- Binary prediction conversion (probability ‚Üí decision)
- Betting result calculation with realistic vig application
- Cumulative P&L tracking with drawdown analysis
- Risk-adjusted performance metrics with financial industry standards

### 3. Model Validation Service (`src/ml/validation/model_validation_service.py`)

**Core Functions**:
- **Model Loading**: MLflow integration for experiment tracking
- **Performance Validation**: Comprehensive model performance assessment against quality gates
- **Business Validation**: Real-world business impact assessment with betting simulation
- **Report Generation**: Detailed validation reports with deployment recommendations
- **CLI Integration**: Seamless integration with existing ML command structure

**Workflow**:
1. Load model from MLflow experiment tracking
2. Run model against test dataset
3. Calculate performance and business metrics
4. Validate against quality gate thresholds
5. Generate comprehensive validation report
6. Make deployment recommendation (approve/block)

### 4. CLI Integration (`src/interfaces/cli/commands/ml_commands.py`)

**Enhanced Commands**:
- `uv run -m src.interfaces.cli ml validate <model_name> <model_version>`: Complete model validation
- `uv run -m src.interfaces.cli ml quality-gates`: Display current quality thresholds
- `uv run -m src.interfaces.cli ml business-metrics <test_data_days>`: Standalone business metrics calculation

**Integration Features**:
- Async command execution with proper database connection handling
- Comprehensive error handling and user-friendly output formatting
- Integration with existing ML training workflows
- Detailed validation reporting with actionable recommendations
