Agent B (Analysis & 
  Strategy) Must Know:

  - Strategy Validation:
  ALL strategy changes
  require backtesting
  validation before
  deployment
  - Data Dependency:
  Cannot proceed until
  Agent A fixes Issue #67
  (ML data pipeline)
  - Performance: Changes
  affecting weekend games
  need special validation
  (known bug pattern)
  - ML Pipeline: Focus on
  Issue #55 (ML Pipeline
  Integration Crisis) as
  highest priority

‚ö†Ô∏è Emergency Protocols

  - Breaking Changes: STOP
   work and notify
  immediately if changes
  affect other agents
  - Test Failures: If
  tests fail on main
  branch, ALL agents must
  be notified immediately
  - Resource Limits:
  Monitor disk space -
  alert at 80% capacity
  - API Cooldowns: If rate
   limit hit, coordinate
  cooldown period across
  all agents

  üìã Documentation 
  Requirements

  - Work Logs: Use the
  structured templates
  from agent_manager.md
  for ALL work sessions
  - Status Updates: Every
  30 minutes using format:
   [AGENT-X][TIME] üîß 
  Issue #XX - File: path -
   Progress: XX% - ETA: XX
   mins
  - Critical Alerts: Use
  üö® format for anything
  that blocks other agents
  - Handoff Reports:
  Prepare comprehensive
  summary at end of each
  session

  üîÑ Git Workflow

  - Branch Naming:
  agent-{A|B|C}/issue-{num
  ber}-{description}
  - Sync Frequency: Pull
  from main every few
  hours: git fetch origin 
  && git merge origin/main
  - Commit Frequency:
  Commit and push changes
  frequently for
  visibility
  - PR Reviews: Require
  review from at least one
   other agent before
  merging
  - Checkpoints: Create
  git tags every 5
  completed issues:
  overnight-checkpoint-N

  üéØ Priority Matrix

  1. Priority 1 
  (Immediate): Issues #73,
   #67, #55, #50, #38,
  #37, #36, #35
  2. Coordination 
  Critical: Any work on
  shared files (config.py,
   core models,
  migrations)
  3. MLB-Specific: Don't
  modify live data
  collection during active
   game windows (late
  night/early morning EST)
