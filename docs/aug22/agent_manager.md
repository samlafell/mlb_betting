# Git Workflow for Agents

1. Assign each agent a distinct set of GitHub issues and ensure that no two agents work on the same files or problems to avoid conflicts.
2. Require agents to regularly pull updates from the main branch (or a designated integration branch) into their own branch/worktree before starting new work, and after completing each issue, to stay up to date and minimize merge conflicts.
   - Example: `git fetch origin && git merge origin/main`
3. Instruct agents to commit and push their changes frequently so that others can see progress and avoid duplicated effort.
4. At the end of each issue or work session, agents should post a brief summary of what they changed to a shared log (Slack, Notion, GitHub comment thread, etc.) for transparency.
5. If an agent‚Äôs work depends on another agent‚Äôs changes, they should coordinate and pull those changes into their branch after they are merged to main.
6. Encourage agents to resolve merge conflicts immediately when they arise, and to communicate any blockers or overlapping work as soon as possible.
7. At regular intervals (e.g., every few hours), agents should re-sync their branches with the main branch to ensure all bugfixes and updates are incorporated.
8. Use pull requests for merging completed work back into main, and require review from at least one other agent to catch issues early.
9. After merging, agents should delete their feature branches to keep the repository clean.
10. If automation is available (e.g., GitHub Actions, bots like Mergify/Renovate), set up automatic notifications or syncing to help keep branches up to date.

## Work Distribution & Conflict Prevention

**11. Issue Categorization & Agent Specialization:**
- **Agent A**: Focus on data collection layer issues (`src/data/collection/`, database schemas, API integrations)
- **Agent B**: Handle analysis & strategy layer issues (`src/analysis/`, backtesting, processors)
- **Agent C**: Manage CLI, services, and core utilities (`src/interfaces/cli/`, `src/services/`, `src/core/`)

**12. File-Level Ownership Matrix:**
- Create a shared document mapping critical files to primary agents
- Mark shared files (like `config.py`, models) as requiring coordination
- Use file-level locks or comments when working on shared components

## Database & Schema Coordination

**13. Database Migration Safety:**
- Only one agent can create/modify database migrations at a time
- Migrations must be numbered sequentially - coordinate through shared counter
- Test migrations on local copy before pushing
- Document all schema changes in the shared log with table/column details

**14. Three-Tier Pipeline Awareness:**
- Changes to RAW schema require coordination with STAGING processing
- STAGING modifications may impact CURATED layer transformations
- Always test the full RAW‚ÜíSTAGING‚ÜíCURATED pipeline after database changes

## Configuration & Environment Management

**15. Configuration Change Protocol:**
- Changes to `src/core/config.py` require immediate notification to other agents
- New environment variables must be documented in shared environment file
- API rate limits and credentials should not be modified without team approval

**16. Dependency Management:**
- Only one agent should modify `pyproject.toml` or add new dependencies
- New dependencies require justification and compatibility check
- Run `uv sync` after pulling any dependency changes

## Testing & Quality Assurance

**17. Continuous Testing Protocol:**
- Run `uv run pytest --cov=src` before each commit
- If tests fail on main branch, immediately notify other agents
- New features must include tests - no exceptions for overnight work
- Use `uv run ruff format && uv run ruff check && uv run mypy src/` before each push

**18. Integration Testing Checkpoints:**
- Every 3 completed issues, run full system integration test
- Test data collection pipeline: `uv run -m src.interfaces.cli data test --source action_network --real`
- Verify database integrity across all three zones (RAW/STAGING/CURATED)

## Communication & Monitoring

**19. Real-Time Status Updates:**
- Update shared status board every 30 minutes with current file/issue
- Use standardized format: `[Agent][Time] Working on: Issue #X - File: path/to/file.py - ETA: XX:XX`
- Immediately flag any blocking dependencies or unexpected complexities

**20. Emergency Escalation:**
- If agent encounters breaking changes that affect other agents, stop work and notify immediately
- Critical system components (database connection, core models) require team approval for changes
- If more than 2 tests fail after a change, revert and reassess

## Data & Output Management

**21. Output Directory Coordination:**
- Only modify files in your assigned subdirectories of `output/`
- Changes to shared analysis results require notification
- Backup important analysis results before modifying processing logic

**22. Log File Management:**
- Use agent-specific log prefixes: `[AGENT-A]`, `[AGENT-B]`, `[AGENT-C]`
- Rotate log files if they exceed 100MB during overnight session
- Monitor disk space - alert if approaching 80% capacity

## Performance & Resource Management

**23. Resource Usage Awareness:**
- Monitor database connection count - PostgreSQL has connection limits
- Coordinate intensive operations (large data imports, backtesting) to avoid resource conflicts
- Use `--dry-run` modes when testing new collection logic

**24. API Rate Limit Coordination:**
- Share API usage tracking - Action Network, SportsBettingDime have daily limits
- If one agent hits rate limit, others should avoid that API for cooldown period
- Use test data when possible instead of hitting external APIs repeatedly

## Recovery & Rollback Procedures

**25. Checkpoint Strategy:**
- Create git tags every 5 completed issues: `overnight-checkpoint-N`
- Maintain working database backup before schema changes
- Document rollback procedures for each major component modification

**26. Morning Handoff Preparation:**
- Prepare summary report of all changes with testing status
- Document any issues that need human review or couldn't be completed
- Ensure main branch is in deployable state with all tests passing
- Create deployment checklist for any new features or configuration changes

## Specific to MLB Betting System

**27. Market Hours Awareness:**
- MLB games typically run until late night/early morning EST
- Don't modify live data collection during active game windows
- Coordinate any changes to odds processing with actual betting market activity

**28. Strategy Validation:**
- Changes to betting strategies require backtesting validation
- Don't modify sharp action detection without historical performance verification
- New analysis must align with existing three-tier pipeline architecture

These guidelines should help prevent the most common overnight collaboration issues while respecting the complex, mission-critical nature of your MLB betting analysis system.
