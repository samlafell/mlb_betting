# Health Check Security Guide

## Overview

Security considerations and hardening procedures for the Health Check Service to ensure secure monitoring without exposing sensitive information.

## Security Principles

### 1. **No Credential Exposure**
- ✅ Database passwords retrieved from environment variables or config
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials in source code
- ✅ Masked connection strings in logs
- ✅ Secure credential management through UnifiedSettings

### 2. **Circuit Breaker Protection**
- ✅ Prevents cascading failures during attacks or overload
- ✅ Automatic service protection with configurable thresholds
- ✅ Graceful degradation under load
- ✅ Recovery mechanisms prevent indefinite blocking

### 3. **Connection Security**
- ✅ Timeout-based connection handling prevents hanging
- ✅ Proper connection cleanup in all code paths
- ✅ Application name identification in database connections
- ✅ Resource leak prevention through finally blocks

## Security Hardening

### Database Security
```python
# Secure database health check configuration
config = HealthCheckConfig(
    connection_timeout_seconds=5,    # Prevent hanging connections
    query_timeout_seconds=10,        # Limit query execution time
    circuit_breaker_failure_threshold=3,  # Faster failure detection
    circuit_breaker_timeout_minutes=5     # Reasonable recovery time
)
```

### Query Security
The health check uses parameterized queries and avoids:
- ❌ Dynamic SQL construction
- ❌ User input in query strings  
- ❌ Privileged operations
- ❌ Data modification commands

**Safe Queries Used**:
```sql
-- Basic connectivity test
SELECT 1;

-- Read-only system information
SELECT 
    pg_database_size(current_database()) as db_size,
    (SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active') as active_connections,
    (SELECT setting::int FROM pg_settings WHERE name = 'max_connections') as max_connections;
```

### Error Message Security
Health check error messages are sanitized to prevent information disclosure:

```python
# ✅ Safe error handling
except Exception as e:
    return ServiceHealth(
        name=service_name,
        status=HealthStatus.UNHEALTHY,
        message=f"Database connection failed: {type(e).__name__}",  # Type only
        metadata={
            "error_type": type(e).__name__,
            "recovery_action": "check_database_connectivity"  # Guidance only
        }
    )
```

### Circuit Breaker Security

Circuit breakers provide security benefits:
- **DDoS Protection**: Prevents resource exhaustion during attacks
- **Cascade Prevention**: Stops failure propagation across services
- **Resource Conservation**: Preserves system resources during incidents
- **Automatic Recovery**: Reduces manual intervention requirements

## Access Control

### Authentication Requirements
- Health check endpoints should require authentication in production
- Use API keys or service-to-service authentication
- Implement rate limiting for health check endpoints
- Log all health check access attempts

### Authorization Levels
```yaml
# Recommended access levels
public_health:
  - Basic system status (UP/DOWN)
  - Response time metrics
  - No detailed error information

authenticated_health:
  - Detailed service status
  - Performance metrics
  - Circuit breaker states
  - Safe error information

admin_health:
  - Full diagnostic information
  - Database statistics
  - Connection details
  - Complete error traces
```

## Monitoring Security

### Secure Logging
```python
# ✅ Secure logging practices
logger.info("Database health check completed", 
           response_time_ms=response_time,
           status=status.value,
           # ❌ Never log: passwords, connection strings, sensitive data
           )
```

### Metrics Security
Health check metrics should exclude:
- ❌ Database connection strings
- ❌ Credential information
- ❌ Internal system paths
- ❌ Detailed error traces

## Production Deployment Security

### Environment Security
```bash
# Secure environment setup
export DB_PASSWORD="$(cat /run/secrets/db_password)"  # From secret management
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:${DB_PASSWORD}@host:port/db"

# ❌ Never use
export DB_PASSWORD="hardcoded_password"
```

### Network Security
- Use encrypted connections (SSL/TLS) for database communication
- Restrict health check endpoint access by IP/network
- Implement proper firewall rules
- Use VPN or private networks for database access

### Container Security
```dockerfile
# Secure container practices
FROM python:3.11-slim

# Don't run as root
RUN adduser --system --group healthcheck
USER healthcheck

# Secure secret management
COPY --chown=healthcheck:healthcheck requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Health check specific security
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --retries=3 \
  CMD python -c "import asyncio; from src.services.monitoring.health_check_service import HealthCheckService; asyncio.run(HealthCheckService().get_system_health())"
```

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Detection
Monitor for:
- Unusual health check failure patterns (potential attack)
- Excessive timeout errors (potential DDoS)
- Circuit breaker activation clustering (system compromise)
- Abnormal database connection patterns

### Response Procedures
1. **Immediate**: Isolate affected services using circuit breakers
2. **Investigation**: Review health check logs and error patterns
3. **Containment**: Adjust circuit breaker thresholds if needed
4. **Recovery**: Verify system integrity before service restoration
5. **Post-Incident**: Update security configurations based on findings

## Security Validation

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials in source code
- [ ] Connection timeouts configured appropriately
- [ ] Circuit breakers configured for security protection
- [ ] Error messages don't expose sensitive information
- [ ] Logging excludes credentials and sensitive data
- [ ] Health check queries are read-only and safe
- [ ] Authentication required for detailed health information
- [ ] Network access properly restricted

### Security Testing
```bash
# Test credential security
grep -r "password.*=" src/ | grep -v "\.get\|\.env\|Field\|default"

# Test for hardcoded secrets
rg "password.*=.*['\"]" src/ --type py

# Validate error message safety
uv run pytest tests/unit/test_health_check_security.py
```

## Configuration Security

### Secure Configuration Template
```python
# Production-ready secure configuration
config = HealthCheckConfig(
    # Performance settings
    cache_ttl_seconds=30,
    connection_timeout_seconds=5,
    query_timeout_seconds=10,
    
    # Security settings
    circuit_breaker_failure_threshold=3,  # Faster protection
    circuit_breaker_timeout_minutes=5,    # Reasonable recovery
    
    # Performance thresholds
    slow_response_threshold_ms=1000,
    critical_response_threshold_ms=5000
)
```

### Environment Variable Security
```bash
# Required secure environment variables
DB_PASSWORD=<secure_password>          # Database password
DATABASE_URL=<full_connection_string>  # Complete connection info

# Optional security enhancements  
HEALTH_CHECK_API_KEY=<api_key>        # API authentication
HEALTH_CHECK_RATE_LIMIT=100           # Requests per minute
HEALTH_CHECK_IP_WHITELIST=10.0.0.0/8  # Allowed networks
```

## Security Monitoring

### Key Security Metrics
- Circuit breaker activation frequency
- Health check authentication failures
- Unusual error patterns or spikes
- Connection timeout frequency
- Resource exhaustion incidents

### Alerting Rules
```yaml
# Critical security alerts
database_circuit_breaker_open:
  condition: circuit_breaker_state == "OPEN"
  severity: critical
  action: immediate_investigation

excessive_timeouts:
  condition: timeout_rate > 10% over 5min
  severity: warning
  action: performance_investigation

import_failures:
  condition: import_error_count > 0
  severity: high
  action: dependency_check
```

## Best Practices

2. **Validate configurations**: Ensure timeout and threshold values are reasonable
3. **Test error scenarios**: Verify security under failure conditions
4. **Review error messages**: Ensure no sensitive data exposure
5. **Monitor circuit breakers**: Track activation patterns for security insights

### Deployment Security
1. **Encrypt connections**: Use SSL/TLS for all database connections
2. **Restrict access**: Limit health check endpoint access by IP/network
3. **Monitor access**: Log and alert on health check access patterns
4. **Regular review**: Periodically review health check security configurations
5. **Update dependencies**: Keep all security-related dependencies current

### Operational Security
