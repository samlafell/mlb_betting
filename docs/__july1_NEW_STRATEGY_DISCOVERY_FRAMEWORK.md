# New Strategy Discovery Framework
## A Comprehensive Guide to Finding Profitable Betting Opportunities

### Executive Summary
This document outlines multiple approaches to discover new, profitable betting strategies by analyzing patterns in betting splits data and game outcomes. Rather than relying on pre-defined strategies that may become noise or lose effectiveness, we aim to build dynamic systems that can identify emerging opportunities through various analytical methods.

## Machine Learning Approaches

### 1. Unsupervised Pattern Discovery

#### Clustering Methods
```python
# Strategy: Identify betting behavior clusters
- K-means clustering on betting splits patterns
- DBSCAN for anomaly detection in public vs sharp money
- Gaussian Mixture Models for probabilistic betting type classification

```

**Implementation Ideas:**

```

**Applications:**
