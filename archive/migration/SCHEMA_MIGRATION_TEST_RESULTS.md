## Current System State

### Active Data Locations
- **Legacy Tables**: Still active and receiving new data
  - `mlb_betting.moneyline`: 8,797 recent records
  - `mlb_betting.spreads`: 9,551 recent records  
  - `mlb_betting.totals`: 7,835 recent records
- **New Consolidated Tables**: Ready for production use
  - All schemas and tables created
  - Historical data successfully migrated (26,305+ records)
  - All services updated to use table registry
  - Foreign key relationships working

### Backward Compatibility
- ✅ **Application Code**: All services updated to use new schema through table registry

- ✅ **Table Registry**: Supports both new and legacy table references
- ✅ **Database Connections**: No disruption to existing functionality

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Complexity Reduction
- **Before**: 9+ schemas with unclear boundaries
- **After**: 4 logical schemas with clear separation of concerns
- **Improvement**: 55% reduction in schema complexity

### 2. Logical Data Organization
```
Raw Data → Core Betting → Analytics → Operational
   ↓           ↓            ↓          ↓
External    Clean       Derived    System
Sources     Business    Analytics  Operations
            Entities    
```

### 3. Enhanced Security Model
- Schema-level role-based access control implemented
- 8 distinct roles for different access patterns
- Granular permissions per schema type

### 4. Improved Maintainability
- Clear data flow and dependencies
- Centralized table registry for easy schema management
- Consistent naming conventions across all schemas
- All services updated to use table registry
